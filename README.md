screen-for-OSX
==============

A version of screen that supports vertical splitting (Shortcut key `Ctrl+A |`), ready for building on OSX (all Apple patches pre-applied)

**Why use this version of screen?**

1. Because the one installed by default on OSX is really old, and doesn't support vertical splitting
2. Vertical splitting is a killer feature that you desperately need
3. You're on a Mac by necessity or choice, and you want to use screen with vertical splits, but don't want to mess with installing the [Apple patches](https://www.opensource.apple.com/source/screen/screen-16/patches/) required for building on OSX
4. Because building and installing your own software is cool


Installation
============

*Note: This requires developer tools to be installed in order to build successfully*
    Use `sudo brew install automake` to install the autoconf tool used in `./install.sh` firstly.

    git clone https://github.com/FreedomBen/screen-for-OSX.git && cd screen-for-OSX && ./install.sh
    
The above command will download, build and install screen into `/usr/local/bin/screen`.  *This does not replace the default `screen` in `/usr/bin/`*.  Make sure to read the section on "Post installation" below.


Post installation
=================

In order to run the new version of screen after it is installed (instead of the default old one), you will either need to reference it by full path (recommended) or rearrange your `PATH` variable so `/usr/local/bin` comes before `/usr/bin` so the new binary is found first (not recommend as it may have unintended side effects).

I recommend creating an alias in your `~/.bash_profile` that simply points `screen` to the new version

    echo 'alias screen="/usr/local/bin/screen"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    
If you don't care about the old version of screen, you can also replace it with the new binary:

    sudo cp /usr/local/bin/screen /usr/bin/screen


Differences from real Screen
============================

These are the things I did to this that make it vary from what you would get if you downloaded the official screen source code:

1. Applied all of the [Apple patches](https://www.opensource.apple.com/source/screen/screen-16/patches/) for `screen`
2. Downloaded and included the required Apple header file [vproc_priv.h](http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/launchd/launchd-328/launchd/src/vproc_priv.h) into the repo so it matches the source here.  *Note: This file is not usually included because it's license is incompatible with the GPLv3.  It's license is Apple Apache*
3. Added an install script to make the build and install process easier
